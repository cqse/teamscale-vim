# Teamscale Pre-Commit with Vim

This repository contains [a compiler plugin](./compiler/teamscale.vim) and [some snippets you can put in your .vimrc](./vimrc.vim) to integrate [`teamscale-dev`](https://docs.teamscale.com/getting-started/other-ides/) with Vim (both original vim and NeoVim).

Please refer to our [installation guide](https://docs.teamscale.com/howto/integrating-with-your-ide/other-ides/#vim-neovim) to use this plugin.
